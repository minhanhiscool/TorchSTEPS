# TorchSTEPS

â˜” A WIP project using PySTEPS and PyTorch to accurately nowcast the weather

## Overview

This code uses Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), which is specified in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04214v2) (We are using the [PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch) of the ConvLSTM paper) to predict the weather using the past 20 minutes of raw radar data and estimates of three classical models (Extrapolation, STEPS, and ANVIL)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Packages listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

Clone the repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/minhanhiscoolish/TorchSTEPS
```
(Optionally) Create a virtual environment in the cloned repository:
```
cd TorchSTEPS
python3 -m venv venv
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage (WIP)
```
python3 src/main.py
```
## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether it's fixing bugs, improving code clarity, etc.

### How to contribute

Clone the repository, then create a new branch for your changes:
```
git clone https://github.com/minhanhiscoolish/TorchSTEPS
git checkout -b feature/my-branch
```
Make your changes. Make sure to follow the coding style.

Test your changes, then commit your changes:
```
git commit -a -m "Commit message"
```
